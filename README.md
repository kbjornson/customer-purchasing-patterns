# customer-purchasing-patterns
Analysis of customer purchasing patterns and demographics based on customer transaction data.

Dataset includes the following information: 
- "in-store" - indicating whether the purchase was made online or in-store (online = 0, in-store = 1)
- "age" - indicating the customer age
- "items" - indicating the number of items purchased per transaction
- "amount" - indicating the amount spent in USD per transaction
- "region" - indicating the region in which the transaction was made (north = 1, south = 2, east = 3, west = 4)

The goal for Task 1 is to perform an initial exploratory data analysis and to specifically answer the questions:
- Do customers in differnt regions spend more per transaction? Which regions spend the most/least?
- Is there a relationship between the number of items purchased and the amount spent?

The goal for Task 2 is to dive deeper into the data by implementing 3 different classification algorithms. The models used were Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The analysis was performed with the following questions in mind:
- Are there differences in the age of customers across the different regions? If so, can we predict the age of a customer in a region based on the other demographic data?
- Is there any relationship between the age of a customer and whether a purchase was made online or in-store? Do any other factors correlate to whether a purchase was made online or in-store?

The results of the analysis are located in the attached .pptx file.
